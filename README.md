MENACE pdfs
===========
The code contained in this repository creates pdfs with the positions required to build a [MENACE](http://mscroggs.co.uk/blog/19).

In order you run this code, you must have `pdflatex` installed.

The file `make_pdfs.py` makes boxes for a MENACE that plays first. The file `make_pdfs_second.py` makes boxes for a MENACE that plays second.

The folder `output` contains the pdfs made by these two scripts.
